## About me

Hello! I am a 5th year PhD student in Computer Science, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). My supervisor is [Prof. Huawei Shen](http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/201402/t20140221_4037648.html ). 

I am broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning and graph neural networks. Most of my current and previous works focus on adversarial attack and defense on graph neural networks. 

**Research interests**: adversarial robustness, graph neural networks, adversarial attack
