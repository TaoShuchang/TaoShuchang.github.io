## About me

Hello! I am a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). My supervisor is [Prof. Huawei Shen](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~shenhuawei/). 

I am broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning and graph neural networks. Most of my current and previous works focus on adversarial attack and defense on graphs. 

**Research interests**: adversarial attack, robustness, graph neural networks.
