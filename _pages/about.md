## About me

Hello! I am currently a senior algorithm engineer in the [Tongyi Lab](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/) at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/). In December 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from CAS Key Laboratory of AI Safety at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/) (ICT, CAS). My supervisor is [Prof. Huawei Shen](http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/201402/t20140221_4037648.html ). 

I am broadly interested in large language model trustworthy machine learning. My current and previous works mainly focus on large language model and adversarial robustness. 

**Research interests**: large language model, trustworthy machine learning, adversarial robustness
